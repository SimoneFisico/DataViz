# From Enrollment to Graduation: Gender and Disciplinary Dynamics in Italian Tertiary Education
### Data Visualization exam project - Master Degree in Data Science - University of Milano-Bicocca  


Students do not just enter and exit the system at the same rate.
These flows vary systematically by gender and discipline, and external shocks such as COVID-19 can reveal underlying structural imbalances.

### Research questions
How are enrollment and graduation patterns in Italian tertiary education distributed across genders and disciplinary areas, and how have these distributions evolved over time?  
How do inflows (enrollments) and outflows (graduates) compare over time, and how does the net balance evolve by gender?  
Does the gender gap vary across disciplinary areas, and how is it reflected in the enrollment–graduation balance?  
Did the COVID-19 period (2020–2021) introduce abrupt changes in these dynamics, or did pre-existing trends remain largely stable?  

### Data Source
The data were retrieved from Eurostat dataset of students enrolled and graduates, filtered to focus on Italian tertiary education, and downloaded in CSV format.   
Eurostat data can be freely reused, downloaded, and redistributed for both non-commercial and commercial purposes, provided the source is properly acknowledged, in accordance with EU Decision 2011/833/EU.
